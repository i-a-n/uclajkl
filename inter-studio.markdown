            <p>The Interdisciplinary Studio area combines artistic production and focused research to support the development of site- and debate-specific forms of critical cultural engagement that extend beyond the framework of individual studio practice. ID students work across artistic mediums, academic disciplines, and social concerns and are encouraged to take advantage of UCLA's extensive academic resources over their three-year course of study. ID Area Head Andrea Fraser serves as the primary advisor to students admitted to this area of study. Students also may work with faculty across other areas within the Department of Art and other departments across the university.</p>
            <p>All MFA students are offered the use of individual studios off-campus in the UCLA Margo Leavin Graduate Art Studios, located in Culver City. In addition to individual studio spaces, the studio building houses photography, sculpture, ceramics, and computer labs, as well as open spaces for exhibitions, lectures, and group critiques. Although the Department of Art does not offer graduate level courses in the summer, the graduate studios are open year-round</p>

            <p>Interdisciplinary Studio was established as an area of study in 1997 by Mary Kelly during her tenure as Art Department Chair. Kelly created ID in response to what she saw as a growing demand among young artists for a graduate program in which they could pursue project-based work driven by social purpose and grounded in interdisciplinary research. Andrea Fraser took over as Area Head in 2017. ID alumni have worked in painting, sculpture, photography, installation, film, video, text, sound, performance, theater, dance, music, architecture, food, law, chemistry, social practice, community organizing, human rights advocacy, and political activism. They include Ph.D.s and Ph.D. candidates from UC Berkeley, Harvard, and Brown; founders of activist groups, dance companies, journals, foundations, and archives; participants Documenta, the Whitney Biennial, PERFORMA, and the Sundance Film Festival; recipients of Herb Alpert and Mohn Awards, and Foundation for Contemporary Art Grants, and Guggenheim and MacArthur Fellowships; and faculty at art schools and universities across the United States and Europe.</p>

            <p>Kearra Amaya Gopee is a multidisciplinary visual artist from Carapichaima, Trinidad and Tobago. Their research-based practice focuses on the nature of violence and erasure, and the particularities of those that are inflicted on the Caribbean and its diasporas by the global north. While complicating the viewer's understanding of economic and social marginalization in the region, their practice also desires to test the mettle of these frameworks. Through their interventions, they aim to temper what we have known to be true with the potential of intuitive knowledges that have been historically cast aside in favour of Western assimilation. They hold a BFA in Photography and Imaging from New York University.</p>
