        <p class="pt-3 mx-5">The New Genres Area curriculum includes moving image, sound, performance, installation, hybrid, and emerging art forms. The program invites students to question preconceived ideas about the roles art plays in society, and to examine how these roles are impacted by specific forms and mediums. To that end, students are encouraged to experiment with artistic process, to track the way that ideas change as they move through various modes of production, and to examine how content is affected by methods of
            display and dissemination.</p>

      <p class="pt-3 mb-0"><strong>New Genres Graduate Studies</strong></p>
      <p>New Genres is one of six areas of study offered in the MFA Art program.  New Genres faculty – Jennifer Bolande, Barbara Kruger, and XXX -  serve as the primary advisors to students admitted to this area of study.  Students have additional opportunities to study with faculty across all other areas within and outside the Department of Art.</p>
      <p>All MFA students are offered the use of individual studios off-campus in the UCLA Graduate Art Studios, located nearby in West Los Angeles. In addition to individual studio spaces, the studio building houses photography, sculpture, ceramics, and computer labs, as well as an open space for gallery, classroom, or lecture use. Although the Department of Art does not offer graduate level courses in the summer, the graduate studios are open year-round.</p>
      <p class="mb-0">For MFA applicants to the New Genres area:</p>
      <p>Please note that  New Genres candidates can include artists who work in theater, film, music, writing, and new media, but generally only when they also have a strong background in modern and contemporary visual art history and are engaged in a dialog with the contemporary visual art field.</p>
