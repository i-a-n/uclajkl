Candice Lin joined the UCLA Department of Art faculty in 2018. Lin’s practice utilizes installation, drawing, video and living processes such as mold, plants, mushrooms, bacteria, fermentation and stains. Lin draws from multiple disciplines to unearth largely forgotten or disregarded histories of colonization and violence and to visualize what has been marginalized or lost, looking at physical material, such as porcelain or cochineal, for new ways to understand racialized, sexualized, and gendered narratives about contamination, authenticity, and mattering. At UCLA, Lin teaches graduate and undergraduate students across disciplines.
