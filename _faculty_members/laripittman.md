Lari Pittman joined the UCLA Department of Art faculty in 1993. Pittman is a Los Angeles-based artist, renowned for his densely layered, richly patterned, and chaotically charged paintings, and his idiosyncratic style. His work undermines aesthetic hierarchies and embraces the decorative and applied arts. Pittman’s early works explored socio-political struggles resulting from the peak of the AIDS epidemic, racial tension, and LGBTQ+ civil rights struggles that defined the last decade of the 20th century, with later paintings moving into interior spaces both domestic and psychological. His most recent works have been devoted to patterns and visual systems as emblematic of society, carving out his place in our contemporary culture of saturated image consumption. At UCLA, Pittman teaches graduate and undergraduate students in painting and drawing.
