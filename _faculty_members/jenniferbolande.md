Professor Jennifer Bolande joined the UCLA Department of Art faculty in 2004. Working in photography, film, sculpture, and site-specific and constructed environments, Bolande explores the quiet affinities between particular sets of objects and images, and the meanings they manufacture. Using one medium to examine the properties and potential of another,
Bolande is interested in the ways in which meaning shifts and transforms in the passage from one medium or context to another. Her work often centers on changing, overlooked or disappearing aspects of the cultural landscape. At UCLA, Bolande teaches undergraduates in the New Genres area and graduate students working in Interdisciplinary Studio.
