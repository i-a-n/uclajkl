Artist Rodney McMillian joined the UCLA Department of Art faculty in 2009. McMillian’s artistic practice embodies a wide range of media and techniques. An overarching concern in his work is the conviction that history is always present; he explores the impacts of historical events on the experience of class, race, and gender in contemporary culture and government policy. At UCLA, McMillian teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in the sculpture area.
