Silke Otto-Knapp joined the UCLA Department of Art faculty in 2014. Known for her landscapes and figurative tableaux that engage with the history of painting, Otto-Knapp’s signature style employs subtle washes of watercolor, slowly built up, layer by layer, on the surface of the canvas to create form. Drawing inspiration from a variety of sources and subject matter, including historical figures, landscapes, seascapes, poetry, modern dance choreography, and theatre design, Otto-Knapp’s work engages both abstraction and representation, simultaneously evoking and erasing form on the picture plane. At UCLA, Otto-Knapp teaches graduate and undergraduate students in painting and drawing.
