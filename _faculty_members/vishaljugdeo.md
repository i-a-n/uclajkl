Vishal Jugdeo joined the UCLA Department of Art faculty in 2018. An interdisciplinary artist working between Los Angeles and New York, Jugdeo uses video, installation, performance, and sculpture to construct experimental approaches to narrative. Weaving together strategies from television, documentary, narrative cinema, and theater, he emphasizes the physical and psychical space around moving images and reveals the mediated process through which we interpret and understand the present as it unfolds. At UCLA, Jugdeo teaches graduate students in interdisciplinary studio and undergraduate students in new genres.
