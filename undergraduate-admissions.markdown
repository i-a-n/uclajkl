			<p>Students are recommended for admission into the department based upon evidence of creative talent and academic achievement. In addition to the general UC application, Art applicants must complete a Supplemental Application which includes a portfolio of 8–10 images and a statement of interest and goals. Beginning January 2, 2018, applicants for the Art major at UCLA who submitted the UC application during the November filing period will be able to log in to the online Supplemental Application. The Supplemental Application must then be completed and submitted online no later than January 20, 2018.</p>

			<p>Applicants can review Supplemental Application guidelines and prepare materials in advance of the January 20 deadline by referring to the Supplemental Application Worksheet.</p>

			<p>Please note that only applicants who indicated Art as their first-choice major on the general UC Application will be considered for admission to the Art major at UCLA.</p>

			<p>Undergraduate screening activities occur in February. Freshman applicants are notified in March; transfer applications are notified in April.</p>
